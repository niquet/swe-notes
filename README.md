# Personal Notes on "The Software Engineer's Guidebook"
This repository is a collection of my personal notes from reading "The Software Engineer's Guidebook" by Gergely Orosz. The notes are not exhaustive and represent only the parts relevant to me, which I have distilled based on my past experiences and future goals as a software engineer. I highly recommend reading this book, whether you're just starting out or are a seasoned engineer.
